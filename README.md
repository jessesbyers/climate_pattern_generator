# ClimatePatternGenerator

The Climate Pattern Generator was designed to automatically generate patterns for knitting or crocheting climate data. 

Users input a zip code and a year, and the program scrapes the daily maximum temperature for that year, and converts that temperature to the corresponding color for representing that temperature in a fiber arts project.

Users can also view a more detailed daily weaher summary for each day of the year after viewing the pattern.

See The Tempestry Project for examples and more details:

Weather data is from the National Climatic Data Center, scraped via the Old Farmer's Almanac:

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'climate_pattern_generator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install climate_pattern_generator

## Usage

The full version of this gem takes approximately 20 minutes to scrape a full year's worth of weather data.

Use the Demo Version (v2) to explore all features of the program with a smaller amount of data.
    After installation, type $ git checkout v2 to use the demo version.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
